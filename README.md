# Heaps-Assignment1
Heaps Data Structure.

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right. There are two types of heaps: Max heap and Min heap. In a Max heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children, ensuring the maximum element is at the root. Conversely, in a Min heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its children, ensuring the minimum element is at the root.

Advantages of Heaps:

Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Heaps allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. The time complexity for these operations is O(log N), making them highly efficient for dynamic data sets.

Priority Queue Implementation: Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are stored based on their priority. This allows for constant-time access to the highest-priority element, making it an efficient data structure for managing tasks or events that require prioritization.

Heap-sort Algorithm: The heap data structure forms the basis for the heap-sort algorithm, an efficient sorting algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). This makes it useful in various applications, including database indexing and numerical analysis.

Space Efficiency: Heaps require less memory compared to other data structures, such as linked lists or arrays, as they store elements in a complete binary tree structure.





Disadvantages of Heaps:

Lack of Flexibility: Heaps are not very flexible as they are designed to maintain a specific order of elements. This makes them less suitable for applications requiring more flexible data structures.
Not Ideal for Searching: While efficient for accessing the top element, heaps are not ideal for searching for a specific element. Searching requires traversing the entire tree, which has a time complexity of O(n).
Not a Stable Data Structure: The heap data structure does not preserve the relative order of equal elements when the heap is constructed or modified.
Complexity in Memory Management: Heaps require dynamic memory allocation, which can be challenging in systems with limited memory. Managing the memory allocated to the heap can also be complex and error-prone.
